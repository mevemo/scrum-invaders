# Scrum-Based-PyGame-Dev-Project

Welcome to our small side-project repository! We are a team of aspiring application developers based in Hamburg, Europe. 

## Introduction

At the start of this project, we were introduced to the Agile methodology, specifically Scrum. Over the next 5 days, we have been experimenting with these newly acquired skills by developing a small software project. 

## Project: Asteroids Clone

After much deliberation, our team decided to develop a clone of the classic game - Asteroids. The language of choice for this project is Python, using the PyGame module for game development. PyGame offers an easy entry point into the world of game development, with syntax that remains general enough to be applicable in various domains, allowing us to utilize our learnings in other areas of software development.

## Project Status and Objectives 

- :telescope: Currently implementing Scrum principles in our development process.
- :seedling: We are in the learning phase, exploring new technologies and practices.

## Future Updates

Stay tuned for more exciting updates as we progress in our learning journey. We are eager to share our challenges, accomplishments, and learning points with the wider development community.
